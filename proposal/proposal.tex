  For a human, the ability to walk is one of the most basic knowledge he learnt
  during his childhood. Since we are trying with AI to, when we can't do better,
  mimic the ability of human being, the idea of teaching a robot to walk comes
  naturally in our mind.\\
  One of the first attempt to do that was to develop an algorithm by trying to
  understand the physics formula of that movement. In 1993,
  \citet{1993-TrunkMotion} tried to make a little robot by trunk motion
  using the ZMP (\gls{ZMP}) and the three
  axis (pitch, yaw and roll)\cite{1993-TrunkMotion}. In 1999, \citeauthor{1999-KHR-2}
  added the OGM (Optimal Gradient Method) to that approach
  to "optimizes the horizontal motion of a trunk to reduce the
  deviation of the calculated ZMP from its
  reference." \cite{1999-KHR-2} and design the KHR-2 robot.
  The result was good but the gait of the robot wasnot very natural because
  it is very difficult to take all the factors in account for making
  the robot walk with a human gait.\\
